    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll go through a short quiz containing the types of questions about SQL and relational databases that you can expect to see in an interview. \n",

    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________The 4 main datatypes in SQLite3 are: text, BLOB, integer and real. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Primary keys are the unique keys assigned to every record in a table. A Foreign key is a column in a table that points to primary key of an record in a different table that an item has a relationship with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "The different types of relationships entities can have in SQL databases are one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. One-to-one is self-explanatory--each record in the table is linked to one, and only one, record in a different corresponding table. An example of a one-to-many relationship would be a Class table and a Student table that we could use to store a class roster. Since one class can have many students, this would be a one-to-many relationship, that would created by giving the Student records a foreign key column that would reference the primary key of the class they are enrolled in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many-to-Many relationships are more complex, because we can have an arbitrary number of records on either side of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "We have 4 types of JOINs in SQL:\n",
    "inner JOIN: Select all records from the left table and the rihgt table, where the join condition is met.\n",
    "left JOIN: Select all records from the left table along with record in the right table, where the join condition is met.\n",
    "right JOIN: Select all records from the right table along with record in the left table, where the join condition is met.\n",
    "full JOIN: Select all records from both table, regardless of if the join condition is met or no.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Aggregate function will compute some values and  GROUP them BY a specific done.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Associative Entities, also called JOIN Tables, are a type of table used to allow us to perform many-to-many JOINs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
